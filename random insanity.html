	Hello you have find this hidden webpage and now it is time for you to see the real CORBIN WALL DUN DUN DUN 
	
<br> 
	<br>
	<br> So the truth about me is I love playing games. 
	<br> 
	<br>My top 5 video games of all times are
<center> God of War/ God of War Ragnarok 
	<br>The Dragon Age Series
	<br> The Mass Effect Series
	<br>
	 Life is Strange
<br> Cyberpunk 2077</center>

  The theme of these games is they are very story driven. My love of story is thanks to my grandmother because any time we would be in the car together we would listen to mystery novels on tape so since before I had thoughts I was hearing stories. <br>
  <br>
  Going through down this rabbit hole of random truth, and connecting to my love of storytelling I also love playing ttrpg or table top role playing games. Like dungeons and dragons which is having a movie come out 3/31/22. In this game I am a Gm or Game Master for the game which means I have to plan everything and run the game for other people. </p>

	 <br> The last thing I wanted to share is I am a huge reader, but because of some learning dyslexia(Which SIDE NOTE why is the word for people who have a hard time reading one of the hardest words to read) I read using mainly audiobooks.I tend to focus on fiction but there are some great nonfiction that I love as well. And using my time I am going to try and manip...I mean I wanted to share some of my faviorte novels with the class.
