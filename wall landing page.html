<p>Hello I am Corbin Wall. I have been working in North Carolina Politics for the last 4 years.  I have worked on 2 major campaigns where I have been a Field Organizer, a Research Assistant, and a Tracker. My goal with these pages is to give you some more information about me, and to hopeful trick you, I mean con you, I mean show you the reasons why giving me money is a wonderful thing that will help me take over the world. I mean help me make the world better for all mankind.<p>
	<br>
	As you can see I like to take random pictures with poltical candiates and at politcal events.
	<br>
	<p> Well if you are still reading this it means you are you either have way too much time on your hands and are looking at a random page on a random server, are Mr. Staff(in which case why don't you just give it this a 100 and save some time watch a movie, go to dinner, relax no need to look any further), or you are part of the class and I am giving this as part of my presentation in which case; that is rough buddies you are trapped looking at long text boxes and too many images.</p>
	<br>
<p> So Let US SET SAIL  </p>
