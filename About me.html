I got into politics because of my grandfather, Gene “Cotton” Wall. He was a lobbyist for the Sprint phone company.

<br>The reason I did this was because everywhere we would go people would stop to talk to him(which as a kid was annoying when you really wanted to do something fast) it felt like he just knew everyone and everyone knew him. And as a kid with chronic diseases who had to spend a lot of time alone and who couldn’t do most group activities that required any physical labor there was nothing that I wanted more. <br>
	
	<br>Another driving force for my life was my Grandma Carol Ann, she pushed me to get into politics because she would just talk about anything and everything that came into her head, and the state of the world was definitely one of those topics. <br>

	She was also someone with a lot of chronic illnesses who didn’t have a lot of money, so I wanted to make a world where she didn’t have to worry about that when it came to her health or any other matter. <br>
	
	I have worked on several campaigns in my life and I hope to work on more with the goal of one day running myself. <br>

<ul>
  <li>As a field director for CADC in the 2020 election</li>
  <li>As a research Assiant for NCDP in the 2022 Senate Election </li>
  <li>And I will hopeful be working in 2024 for either the Governortoral or Presidential elections in 2024</li>
</ul>
